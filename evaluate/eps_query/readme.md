see the bash scripts in `bash` path.
The codes are split into {small, medium, large}. 
+ `eps_metrics_{small, medium, large}_graph.sh` generates the results for `figure 6`, which means the compute the all-pair additive error vs time.
+ `eps_metrics_{small, medium, large}_graph_thres.sh` generates the results for `figure 8`, which means using the all-pair results to compute the F1-score under different threshold.
