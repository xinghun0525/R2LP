## Figure 12 Replication

This section describes the replication of Figure 12 from the research paper. Figure 12 is primarily obtained through code modification from [Simga](https://github.com/ConferencesCode/SIMGA). In this replication, we conduct all-pair SimRank Joins on two datasets, Cora and Pokec, using R2LP and Opt-LP algorithms. We use the estimated SimRank matrices as the matrices used in the model. Finally, we evaluate and compare the accuracy of the results.

`draw.ipynb` shows how to generate the figure 12.
