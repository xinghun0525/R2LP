this code is for experiment of `figure 6: Additive error of SimRank estimation` in our paper.

`eps_query_{small, medium, large}_graph.sh`: run the bash and generate the results for all-pair SimRank Query.

The experiment results are generated under the path `result_eps` and the logs are generated under 
`log/eps_query`
